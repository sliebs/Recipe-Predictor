This project predicted the ratings of a recipe based on its ingredients. 

Please refer to the recipe predictor write up .pdf for a more detailed explanation of my methods and results.

The dataset I used was from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shuyangli94/food-com-recipes-and-user-interactions
This dataset included over 180,000 recipes and 700,000 reviews spanning around 18 years.

Simply put, I used a bag-of-words sentiment analysis on ingredients in conjunction with preparation and
nutrition data. Improved baseline MSE by 20%-60% by analyzing recipes with a certain minimum number of reviews
